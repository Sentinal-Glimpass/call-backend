# Architecture Ideas & Future Improvements

## Hot-Cold Data Architecture Pattern

### Redis-First, MongoDB-Fallback Strategy

**Concept**: Use Redis as the primary working database for active data (0-30 days), then automatically transfer to MongoDB for long-term storage and analytics.

**Architecture Overview**:
```
Redis (Hot Data - 0-30 days):
├── Active campaign status & metrics
├── Real-time call tracking & state
├── Live counters & analytics
├── Session data & temporary states
└── High-frequency atomic operations

MongoDB (Cold Data - 30+ days):
├── Historical campaigns & call logs
├── Analytics & reporting data
├── Audit trails & compliance data
└── Complex queries & aggregations
```

**Implementation Strategy**:

1. **Dual Write Pattern**:
   - Write critical data to both Redis and MongoDB
   - Redis for immediate operations
   - MongoDB as backup and for persistence

2. **TTL-Based Migration**:
   - Set 30-day TTL on Redis keys
   - Background job transfers expiring data to MongoDB
   - Automatic cleanup of old Redis data

3. **Smart Read Strategy**:
   - Check Redis first for recent data
   - Fallback to MongoDB for historical queries
   - Cache frequently accessed historical data back to Redis

**Benefits**:
- **10-100x performance improvement** for active operations
- **Cost optimization** (expensive Redis for hot data, cheaper MongoDB for cold)
- **Automatic data lifecycle management** via TTL
- **Scalability** - Redis handles high-frequency operations, MongoDB handles complex analytics
- **Natural separation** of operational vs analytical workloads

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Data consistency between Redis and MongoDB
- Migration job reliability and monitoring  
- Fallback mechanisms for Redis failures
- Query abstraction layer to handle both systems
- Testing strategy for dual-system architecture

**Ideal for Telephony Systems**:
- Active calls need millisecond response times
- Historical call data needs complex querying
- Clear hot/cold data separation
- High write frequency during campaigns
- Analytics on historical data

**Next Steps**:
1. Design data migration strategy
2. Implement abstraction layer for database operations
3. Create TTL-based archival jobs
4. Add monitoring for both systems
5. Gradual migration of high-frequency operations to Redis
